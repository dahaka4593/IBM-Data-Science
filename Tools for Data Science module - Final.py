# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[8]:


45*56+(4/3)
# This expression multiplies 45 and 56 and adds 4/3 


# In[9]:


4 + 4
#This expression adds two numbers


# In[10]:


25 / (5+10)
#This expression divides 25 over the sum of 10+5.


# In[11]:


x = 200   #minutes
y = x/60  #x in terms of hours. The decimal is not in minutes.
print(y)
